# üè† House Price Prediction App

This project is an interactive web application that predicts house prices in Melbourne based on their features. It uses Linear Regression and Random Forest models trained on the [Melbourne Housing Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot) dataset.

## Features

- Intuitive user interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- Price prediction using two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Automatic encoding of categorical variables
- Data scaling for improved accuracy
- Real-time display of prediction results
